# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [VITE JS](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

#### Folders

- **components**: contains all the components used in this app, where each component folder contains minimum a tsx file and a .scss
- **hooks**: contains hooks that are used more than once in the project
- **services**: all api services
- **style**: contains global style files
- **types**: contains generic types on the app
- **views**: all screens inside the project

## Store

Store is managed with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#building-for-production) for more information.
